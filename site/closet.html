My babies. Everything about this boot from the construction to the feel is like no other. I got these
new and were like a very serious purchase that I justified by Guidi's construction and because I think
they're beautiful. My favorite details is the dyeing process that happens after construction which very
neat and the back zip which is a great calling card for people in the know.

<p>
A birthday gift to myself this year (I split the cost with my mom). Its second hand, which is a big plus
for me as I usually buy used because it feels more sustainable. Plus the leather on this looks great worn. 
I'm actually not quite sure what year this is from, but its basically my only bag besides 
my little cross body. The handle on a bag thats this small is so fun to carry around and gives it such 
a unique look when I'm wearing it on my shoulder. I have really come to love a good purse and this one 
suits me very nicely.
