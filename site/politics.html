    My goal is to create an equitable and sustainable world, filled with joy, 
    mystery, excitement, and fulfillment. To this end, I am: anti-fascist and
    promote the liberation of all peoples across the world.
    </p>

    <p>
    Sustainability means that we regain our place within the world, and give 
    back in proportion to the gifts given to us.
    </p>

    <p>
    A lot of my understanding of this balance are inspired by Robin Wall Kimmerer's 
    <b>Braiding Sweetgrass</b>. Her work has been instrumental in focusing
    my vision for the future, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has given
    into climate nihilism.

    I believe the path to attaining this future is possible through 
    collective action and cooperation on all facets: human to human, 
    human to nature, human to world. This approach is naturally opposed to our 
    current system of capitalism in many ways. I promote socialism as a known 
    system that I believe aligns with my goals, however strict dogmatism does 
    not lead to progress. That being said capitalism is self sustaining and 
    necesitates exploitation. Capitalism is a powerful drug that we humans must 
    wean ourselves off of, before it causes our's and other's demise.
