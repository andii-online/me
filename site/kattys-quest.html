<p>
Katty's Quest is a first person exploration game built in the Unity game engine that I decided to create during the 
beginning of the global covid-19 pandemic. I worked on it for over a year and eventually released it on itch.io.
</p>

<p>
Katty's Quest was written in the C# language in Unity. The dialogue in the game was written in the yarn language 
developed by the Night in the Woods team and run using the Yarn Spinner Unity plugin. I designed all the code,
art, story that is present in the game. I used photoshop for image editing.

<h2>Design Process</h2>

<p>
Orignally Katty's Quest started out as a prototype game built for the Game Engine Prototyping course at Northeastern.
The game was a first person shooter where you had to water angry plants to make them happy again. In this demo
I started experimenting with yarn and was inspired to flesh out the test character I built for that demo.
</p>

<p>
The world design started as a top-down sketch of the main island and included different areas, most of which are 
still present in the final game!
</p>

<p>
I used a very iterative approach to fleshing out the world and characters. Characters start as simple ideas: a farmer, a
conspiracy theorist, or a incoherant old-man-bird. And then through the story writing process would gain more details, such 
as their relation to other characters, backgrounds, etc. The world design took a similar approach and features were scuplted
and added to the world to suit play and story needs as they came up.
