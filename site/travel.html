    I haven't traveled too much since starting transition. Body scanners become
    more tricky the more my body diverges from what a tsa worker expects. Most
    of the time its just funny to me.
    </br>
    I kindof think that the places that I can visit safetly visit
    has decreased :p
    </br>
    Hopefully I get to see more of the world soon!

    Currently my partner and I are traveling around western Europe: Germany,
    Netherlands, UK, France, Spain, Italy. While I find it very difficult to keep
    a daily record of goings on, I have been having many thoughts about life here
    and how it differs from back home in America.
