<h1>explicitly political</h2>

<p>my goal is to create an equitable and sustainable world, filled with joy, 
mystery, excitement, and fulfillment. to this end, i am: anti-fascist and
promote the liberation of all peoples across the world.</p>

<p>sustainability means that we regain our place within the world, and give 
back in proportion to the gifts given to us.</p>

<p>a lot of my understanding of this balance are inspired by robin wall kimmerer's 
<b>Braiding Sweetgrass</b>. her work has been instrumental in focusing
my vision for the future, and i highly recommend it to anyone who has given
into climate nihilism.</p>

<p>i believe the path to attaining this future is possible through 
collective action and cooperation on all facets: human to human, 
human to nature, human to world. this approach is naturally opposed to our 
current system of capitalism in many ways. i promote socialism as a known 
system that i believe aligns with my goals, however strict dogmatism does 
not lead to progress. that being said capitalism is self sustaining and 
necesitates exploitation. capitalism is a powerful drug that we humans must 
wean ourselves off of, before it causes our's and other's demise.</p>
