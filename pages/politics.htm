    My goal is to create an equitable and sustainable world, filled with joy, 
    mystery, excitement, and fulfillment. To this end, I am: anti-fascist and
    promote the liberation of all peoples across the world.

    Sustainability means that we regain our place within the world, and give 
    back in proportion to the gifts given to us.

    <p>
    A lot of my understanding of this balance are inspired by Robin Wall Kimmerer's 
    <b>Braiding Sweetgrass</b>. Her work has been instrumental in focusing
    my vision for the future, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has given
    into climate nihilism.

    I believe the path to attaining this future is possible through 
    collective action and cooperation on all facets: human to human, 
    human to nature, human to world. This approach is naturally opposed to our 
    current system of capitalism in many ways. I promote socialism as a known 
    system that I believe aligns with my goals, however strict dogmatism does 
    not lead to progress. That being said capitalism is self sustaining and 
    necesitates exploitation. Capitalism is a powerful drug that we humans must 
    wean ourselves off of, before it causes our's and other's demise.
