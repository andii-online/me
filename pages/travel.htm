    i haven't traveled too much since starting transition. body scanners become
    more tricky the more my body diverges from what a tsa worker expects. most
    of the time its just funny to me.
    </br>
    i kindof think that the places that i can visit safetly visit
    has decreased :p
    </br>
    hopefully i get to see more of the world soon!

    currently my partner and i are traveling around western europe: germany,
    netherlands, uk, france, spain, italy. while i find it very difficult to keep
    a daily record of goings on, i have been having many thoughts about life here
    and how it differs from back home in america.
