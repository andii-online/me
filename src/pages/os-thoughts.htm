<h1>thinking about os development...</h1>

<h2>operating system education</h2>
<p>heres what i am looking at to learn more about operating systems</p>
<li><a href="https://os.phil-opp.com/">Philipp Oppermann's blog</a>: about 
    os development in rust!</li>

<h2>fantasy os</h2>

<p>
here is a compilation of requirements i have for a future operating system.
</p>
<h4>the system:</h4>
<li>is accessible to all users</li>
<li>respects the user's time and delivers functionality in a timely manner, so the device can be used swiftly and put away when not needed</li>
<li>has plenty of room for user applications</li>
<li>gives control to the user</li>
<li>is not designed in a way that impedes its use</li>
<li>is friendly and helpful</li>
<li>evolves to fit it's user's needs</li>
<li>improves over time (security, performance, reliability, reduction in external harm)</li>
<li>has a community surrounding it. people believe in the system and want to be involved with others who care about it</li>
<h4>the user:</h4>
<li>fully owns their own operating system</li>
<li>feels connected with their operating system</li>

<p>i expect this list to change a lot as a learn more (about operating systems but also about software in general). 

if you have any requirements u feel are necessary for software that i have left out, please message me!
