<p>
Katty's Quest is a First Person Narrative Experience about exploring an island,
talking to its residents, and making friends. The focus of this
experience was to create a world that feels real and lived in and makes
you feel happy and calm. I want to shift the space the focus of games
towards making the world a better place and that philosophy was core to
Katty's Quest's design.
